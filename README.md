# Uncommon HTML Error: Inefficient innerHTML Usage
This repository demonstrates a subtle yet potentially problematic way to use `innerHTML` in HTML, leading to unexpected behavior. The error lies in how the `innerHTML` property is repeatedly manipulated.  While the first append operation is standard and correct, the second approach can be significantly less efficient and prone to unexpected issues.  This can create performance problems or even infinite loops in complex scenarios.

The solution illustrates a more efficient and reliable method for DOM manipulation using `insertAdjacentHTML`. This is recommended for better performance and to avoid potential pitfalls.
